One of the main impacts of sight and hearing loss is on a person’s ability to communicate with others, participate in education and employment, travel and function in everyday life. The burden of chronic eye disease is expected to grow in line with a significant increase in the ageing population and lifestyle-related diseases like diabetes.

The goal of the project was to facilitate easier access to electronic information for deaf-blind people. To achieve this goal, the group  developed a tactile user interface for a smartphone, to allow users with limited vision and hearing, the ability to interact with electronic information via tactile stimuli.

The group constructed an electronic glove which, when worn, kinaesthetically stimulates the user’s hand to recreate the six points of a Braille character using vibrating motors. The glove device links wirelessly to a smartphone or keyboard, accessing dynamically-changing text sources (such as web pages and text messages). A small Braille keypad supplementing the glove allows the user to send responses via Braille code. The device enables near-real-time communication for the user with consumer electronic devices and from peer devices.
